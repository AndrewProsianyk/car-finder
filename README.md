Car Finder â€” Car Search Platform

Tech stack: React, Vite, Zustand, Sass, React Router, Node.js, Express, REST API

Description:

Car Finder is a responsive single-page application for browsing and filtering cars based on various parameters such as price, year, body type, fuel type, transmission, and more. The project includes a minimal backend built with Express.js that handles filtered requests and returns matching results.

Key Features:

Advanced filtering: Users can filter cars by multiple criteria with real-time updates.

Favorites system: Cars can be marked as favorites and persisted locally.

Routing: Client-side routing with React Router.

State management: Zustand is used to manage UI state and filters.

Backend API: A simple Node.js + Express backend powers the car data and supports filter-based endpoints.

Clean UI: Built with Sass and custom components for flexible styling.

Why it matters:

This project showcases my ability to develop a full-featured frontend application and integrate it with a functional backend API, following best practices in state management, routing, and component architecture.
